purposely show u about my entire mood in coding

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes the code slaps. Sometimes it’s just vibes. Sometimes it exists purely so the streak doesn’t die.

If you see simple code, messy bits, questionable structure, or something that feels very “meh” — congrats, you get the vision.

One goal only: keep GitHub green 🌱 and keep coding feeling human (pls).

Look around if you want. Just… manage your expectations😌
